# Tool for Web Scraping

This project uses Beautful Soup, a Python library to pull data out of HTML and XML files. 
What I love about this tool is that it is easy to use and follow. The document about the library could be found here: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

# Motivation

My roomate and I were discussing about the correlation between the sun and depression. To prove my point that less sun is correlated to depression rate, I gather the data to support my hypothesis.
